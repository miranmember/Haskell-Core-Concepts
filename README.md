# Haskell-Core-Concepts
This Haskell project contains several programs that demonstrate various core concepts of the language, including functions, case statements, input/output, file manipulation, and recursion.


## Usage
To run a specific program, navigate to the directory containing the file and use the following command:
```
ghc <filename>.hs
./<filename>
```

## Programs
1. **'case.hs'**: This program prompts the user to enter a letter between a and d. The program will then call the corresponding function based on the input.
2. **'copyIo.hs'**: This program prompts the user to enter the names of two files. The program will then copy the contents of the first file to the second file, if both files exist.
3. **'findTheA.hs'**: This program defines a function findTheA that takes a list of strings and returns a new list containing only the strings that start with the letter A. The main function demonstrates the use of the findTheA function on a sample list of strings.
4. **'terminalIo.hs'**: This program prompts the user to enter a series of numbers, separated by newlines. The program will terminate when the user enters a period (.). The program will then print the sum of the entered numbers.
